# Rick and Morty Character Explorer: A Wubba Lubba Dub Dub App 🚀

Welcome, fellow adventurers! This project allows you to explore the vast multiverse of Rick and Morty characters. It's a dimension-hopping, time-traveling app built using React, React Bootstrap, and TypeScript.

## Overview 🌍

Hold on to your Meeseeks boxes, because this app will guide you through the wild and wonderful universe of Rick and Morty characters. Explore infinite character possibilities by filtering names, statuses, and genders. Plus, you can time-travel through pages of intergalactic results using the pagination controls.

## Architecture 🌌

The project is built on the sturdiest of space-age technology, using React, React Bootstrap, and TypeScript. Gather 'round the Meeseeks box and discover the components and utils folded up in their cozy spaces.

## Components 📦

- `App.tsx`: The mothership of the app, fueling data fetching, state management, and rendering smaller components.
- `Character.tsx`: See into the soul of each character, including details about their species, gender, badge-bearing status, and an image.
- `Filters.tsx`: A toolbox for bending dimensions as you pinpoint specific characters by name, status, and gender.
- `Footer.tsx`: A wormhole of information at the bottom of the page.
- `Header.tsx`: Seeing "Rick and Morty" emblazoned across the top will awaken your inner time traveler.
- `Message.tsx`: Space-age communication for mortals: display messages with a perfectly suited image.
- `PaginationControls.tsx`: Hitch a ride through space and time with easy-to-use pagination.

## Utils 🌠

- `Api.tsx`: Feeds on data from the depths of the Rick and Morty API using the fetchCharacters function.
- `ImgUrls.tsx`: (Please provide this file to include more information in the README.md)
- `Types.tsx`: (Please provide this file to include more information in the README.md)

## Testing 🧪

In a separate dimension, the `__tests__` folder houses test files dedicated to examining the components and utils. The interdimensional essence of the tests ensures the application's mechanics are in check.

## How to Run the Project 🏁

1. Ensure your spaceship is equipped with Node.js; install it into your system.
2. Clone or download this galactic repository full of interdimensional wonders.
3. Launch your terminal or command prompt and aim it at the project folder, where the `package.json` mastermind resides.
4. Run `npm install` to nurture all necessary dependencies.
5. Finally, run `npm start` and watch with glee as the development server blasts off, launching the application into browser orbit, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

Or, for our Yarn connoisseurs:

1. Run `yarn install` to equip your ship with essential components.
2. Initiate launch with `yarn start` and embark on your journey to `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Test the Project 🧬

1. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder (home of the `package.json` mastermind).
2. Run `npm test` to perform a cosmic test-run. All test results will dance before your eyes in a wondrous display of interdimensional success.

Or, for those who prefer Yarn:

1. Engage the `yarn test` command for a Yarn-flavored test experience.

So, come on, grab your portal gun and let's explore the Rick and Morty Character Explorer together! ✨
